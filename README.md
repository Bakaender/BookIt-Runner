# BookIt-Runner
Basic endless runner mobile game Developed 06/2017 to 09/2017

This game was made with the goal of learning Unity. It was made by 4 people. 1 programmer, 1 artist, and 2 level designers. 
We set out with the goal of making the game in 3 months, and suceeeded in doing so with minimal cuts to planned content.

I didn't program the player controller, it is an asset from Prime31. I also used an asset for the camera control, which I could easily program myself at this point, but I didn't have the time to do so with the time constraint during development.

If I were to make the project again I would break up everything in the player movement class, as it kinda handles everything for the entire game.
